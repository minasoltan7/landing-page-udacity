# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

This project is a *dynamic landing page* that enable the user to interact and add new section instantly.

Main objective is to manipulate the *DOM* to create new content to the website without any *virtual DOM frameworks*

The navigation bar updates with the *active section* and the new created sections using the **IntersectionObserver API**.

I prefered using *.insertAdjacentHTML()* method instead of the *.appendChild()* to add new sections and new *navbar list item*.

I used *scrollIntoView()* method and added an event listener to each *li* element to scroll to the specific *section* that is clicked. 



## Technologies and Frameworks Used

* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Javascript**
* **Bootstrap**
