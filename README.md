# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

This project is a dynamic landing page that enable the user to interact and add new section instantly.
The navigation bar updates with the active section and the new created sections using the IntersectionObserver API.
I prefered using .insertAdjacentHTML() method instead of the .appendChild().
I am using the smooth scroll behavior to scroll between different sections

## Other Framworks Used

-Bootstrap
